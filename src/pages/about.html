      <h2 class="cs-title">The South End Neighborhood Council</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
                SENCo is one of eight Neighborhood Councils formed by the City of Tacoma in 1992. We are an independent non-profit corporation that addresses issues and concerns at the neighborhood level and works cooperatively with neighborhood groups for the attainment of neighborhood goals. SENCo seeks to encourage the participation of all citizens in the governmental process and maximize the use of resources through the concepts of community and group organization through utilization of available services and funding sources. We believe quality of life within our neighborhoods is a common interest, and it is our goal to prioritize social and economic justice by building and maintaining relationships within our communities. SENCo aims to foster a partnership of open communications between all groups, the City of Tacoma (CoT), and its neighborhoods.
            </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
                While SENCo Board Members must live within Neighborhood Council boundaries, the term “Neighborhood Council” not only includes the 11 SENCo Board Members, but all residents, property owners, business owners, and employees who live or work in Neighborhood Council boundaries.
          We are Working Together to Make the South End Better …for everyone in the South End!

                    In September 1992, the City Council passed legislation designating eight Neighborhood Councils whose boundaries correspond to the City’s traditional planning areas. Each Neighborhood Council serves as an independent, non-profit citizen-based efforts for neighborhood improvement!
